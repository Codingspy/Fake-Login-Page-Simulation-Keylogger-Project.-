# Fake Login Page Simulator with Keylogger Demo

This project is a simple and educational simulation of phishing attacks combined with basic keylogging, implemented using Python and the CustomTkinter library.

## Features

- Choose between fake login pages for Facebook, Gmail, or Instagram.
- Enter fake credentials in a GUI login window designed to look like the chosen platform.
- The entered credentials are recorded and displayed in a safe, educational manner.
- The application warns users about the dangers of phishing and keylogging.
- Includes logos, dynamic styling, and log management.

## Purpose

**It runs locally on your machine and does NOT send any data externally.**  
**Do NOT use this for malicious intent.**
